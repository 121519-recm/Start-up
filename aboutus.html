            <p class="p-3 fs-4 mt-5">Fundraising for Operation #NotForgotten began in August 2019, initiated by Laurie Cooper of Canada Caring Society, and the first applications were lodged in December 2019. As at December 2022:</p>
            <ul class="mb-5 text-body-secondary fs-4">
              <li class="mb-3 fs-5">Operation #NotForgotten has raised AU$5.3 million, of which AU$4.85 million has been raised in Australia through the Refugee Council of Australia.</li>
              <li class="mb-3 fs-5">With the funds raised, MOSAIC has active sponsorship applications for 170 refugees and 139 separated family members â€“ 309 resettlement spots.</li>
              <li class="mb-3 fs-5">Of these, the first 23 sponsored refugees have already been resettled to Canada and have begun new lives there.</li>
              <li class="mb-3 fs-5">MOSAIC and Ads-Up Canada have teams of volunteers in five provinces across Canada (British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta and Manitoba) ready to receive the refugees as they arrive.</li>
              <li class="mb-3 fs-5">Dozens more refugees are expected to arrive in Canada throughout 2023 and the process of family reunion is expected to begin very soon. Once refugees are resettled, they have 12 months to apply for visas for the spouses and children included in their sponsorship applications. The arrival of family members will end 10 years of separation for the refugees sent to Nauru and Manus Island in 2013.</li>

Those evacuated to Australia remain in community detention or are living on Final Departure Bridging Visas, with no access to a financial safety net. The Australian Government policy (supported by both the recently elected Labor government and the Liberal-National opposition) is that refugees from this group will not be allowed to settle permanently in Australia.</p>

              <li class="mb-2 fs-5">Myo Win, a Rohingya refugee who spent eight years on Nauru, explains what it means to him to be sponsored to Canada and how much he is looking forward to being reunited with his wife and children who are currently in very difficult circumstances in Asia.</li>
              <li class="mb-2 fs-5">Bryan Gaensler, the 1999 Young Australian of the Year and now a permanent resident of Canada, shares how his grandmotherâ€™s experience as a refugee fleeing Nazi Germany has influenced his decision to become a volunteer with Ads Up Canada. He is part of the team of volunteers welcoming ex Nauru and Manus refugees to Toronto.</li>
